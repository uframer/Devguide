# Installing Files and Code

The PX4 code can be developed on [Mac OS](../setup/dev_env_mac.md), [Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux.md) or [Windows](../setup/dev_env_windows.md). Mac OS and Linux are recommended since image processing and advanced navigation cannot be easily developed on Windows. If unsure, new developers should default to Linux and the current [Ubuntu LTS edition](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).

## Development Environment

The installation of the development environment is covered below:

  * [Mac OS](../setup/dev_env_mac.md)
  * [Linux](../setup/dev_env_linux.md)
  * [Windows](../setup/dev_env_windows.md)

If you're familiar with Docker you can also use one of the prepared containers: [Docker Containers](../test_and_ci/docker.md)

Once finished, continue to the [build instructions](../setup/building_px4.md).
