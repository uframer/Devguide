# AirSim Simulation

AirSim is a open-source, cross platform simulator for drones, built on Unreal Engine. It provides physically and visually realistic simulations of Pixhawk/PX4 using either Hardware-In-The-Loop \(HITL\) or Software-In-The-Loop \(SITL\).

The main entry point for the documentation is the [Github AirSim README](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/README.md).

## HITL

The instructions for [HITL setup are here](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/prereq.md).

The walkthrough video below shows the setup for HITL with Pixhawk in more detail.
