# Windows开发环境

> **警告** Although a Windows toolchain is available, its not officially supported and we discourage its use. It is unbearably slow during Firmware compilation and does not support new boards like Snapdragon Flight. It also cannot run the standard robotics software packages many developers use to prototype computer vision and navigation. Before starting to develop on Windows, consider installing a dual-boot environment with [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com).

## 开发环境安装

下载并安装如下软件：

  * [Qt Creator IDE](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-6)
  * [PX4 Toolchain Installer v14 for Windows Download](http://firmware.diydrones.com/Tools/PX4-tools/px4_toolchain_installer_v14_win.exe) (32/64 bit systems, complete build system, drivers)
  * [PX4 USB Drivers](http://pixhawk.org/static/px4driver.msi) (32/64 bit systems)

接下来请按照[构建PX4软件](starting-building.md)的指导操作。
