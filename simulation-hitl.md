# Hardware in the Loop Simulation (HITL)

Hardware in the loop simulation is a simulation mode where the autopilot is connected to the simulator and all flight code runs on the autopilot. This approach has the benefit of testing the actual flight code on the real processor.

## 配置HITL系统

PX4 supports HITL for multicopters (using jMAVSim) and fixed wing (using X-Plane demo or full). Flightgear support is present as well, but we generally recommend X-Plane. To enable it, configure it via the airframe menu.

## 切换到摇杆输入

If a joystick is preferred over a radio remote control, set the parameter `COM_RC_IN_MODE` to `1`. It can be found in the Commander parameter group.

## 启用从X-Plane的远程访问

In X-Plane two key settings have to be made: In Settings -> Data Input and Output, set these checkboxes:

In Settings -> Net Connections in the Data tab, set localhost and port 49005 as IP address, as shown in the screenshot below:

## 在QGroundControl中启用HITL

Widgets -> HIL Config, then select X-Plane 10 in the drop-down and hit connect. Once the system is connected, battery status, GPS status and aircraft position should all become valid:

## 在HITL中执行自主任务

Switch to the flight planning view and put a single waypoint in front of the plane. Click on the sync icon to send the waypoint.

Then select MISSION from the flight mode menu in the toolbar and click on DISARMED to arm the plane. It will take off and loiter around the takeoff waypoint.
